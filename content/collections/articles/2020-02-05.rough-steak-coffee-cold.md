Had a rough day, came to terms with some personal failings, spent time reevaluating priorities, and decided I need to find a way to dig deeper and give more of myself to my business. I’m not sure exactly how I’ll do it, but the first thing to do will be my personal, free (non-family) time. I haven’t earned it and don’t deserve it.

Date night with Jen. Went to The Mercantile in Saratoga. The 12oz NY strip steak with brussel sprouts and spinach was delicious. Decaf coffee at Uncommon Grounds afterwards.


It was just the evening I needed to decompress and talk everything out from today. I love my wife.

It was damn cold out there though.
