Well then. We've been living in Florida for over a year now and I simply cannot believe it. It's been incredible. I don't know why we waited so long to do this.

All the usual routines went out the window after the move – in a good way – and for various reasons and excuses I haven't written anything anywhere for quite some time. I thought this might be the easiest and most pain-free place to jot some thoughts down and try to loosen the writers block.

We fish now. As a family. We fish a lot, and we're all in. All five of us. Super hooked. We joined the Freedom Boat Club and are out on the water a few times a month, and we've gotten pretty good at it. I can't imagine a time without it now, which just shows you how fast times change.

Ellie is 6 and I can't even.
