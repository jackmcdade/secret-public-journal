Felt frazzled pretty much the whole day. So much context switching, so many emails, but I finished important things and I am relieved.

Launched the new [Statamic Freelance Partners](https://statamic.com/partners#freelance) section of statamic.com and already was able to refer some work to these fine devs. I love the Statamic community.

Played [Not Parent Approved](https://amzn.to/2OweKa9) with the kids after dinner — essentially Cards Against Humanity but safe for kids. Had a blast. Evan got the award for the most hilarious card combo.
