Twice-a-Day workouts began today. At 7:30 I'm doing the regular [Purebred](https://purebredathetlics.com) group class (similar to CrossFit but without the crazy stuff, and lately — no barbells).

Then at 9am Jen and I are both in the VIP program, a tailored personal-training-style weightlifting session with Ryan. Today was benchpress. It's been so long since I've regularly done _anything_ with barbells. My numbers weren't worth mentioning, but I'm excited to be pushing hard on strength again.

## Dungeons & Dragons

D&D this evening with my crew. They battled an 18' pig demon for almost 2 hours and then spent some time chatting with it's reanimated mouth. As one does.

## Didn't Snack at all today

Didn't get enough protein today but also had a nice deficit. This is pretty important to me right now — I really want to go balls-to-the-wall and get in the best shape I can before we leave NY and say good-bye to the crew at Purebred. I kinda see it as my good-bye present to them. I know they take pride in people changing their bodies and lives, and I want to show them how much the last 5+ years has meant to me.

I have almost 12 weeks left here. It's enough time to make a noticeable difference.
