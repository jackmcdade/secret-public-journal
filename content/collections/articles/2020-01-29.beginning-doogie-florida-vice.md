Starting a secret journal has been on my to-do list for a long time. It's always been combined with the eventual redesign of [jackmcdade.com](https://jackmcdade.com), but as I've shelved 4 different designs so far, it was going nowhere. Designing a personal site that reflects your personality in a meaningful way is tough.

So I built this instead. The [Doogie Browser](https://github.com/statamic/starter-kit-doogie-browser) starter kit. This is all I really ever wanted. All I ever needed. A place to dump my thoughts that wasn't Twitter, wasn't necessarily a blog, and could just be whatever I want it to be instead of what I think people want.

## In other news

This was a really monumentous week.

Back in the fall we had listed our house for sale so we can move to Florida, but failed to close a reasonable deal. It just kinda fell apart. It was hard. We had a contract on a house in Florida, and had gotten all the way through inspections. I spiraled quite a bit, emotionally and spiritually and put on almost 10 lbs. When we decided to take it off the market, Jen and I had a peace about it. We knew it wasn't the right time, we just didn't know why.

Last week — completely out of the blue — several families contacted us within a day of each other asking if we were still considering selling our house. It wasn't even on the market, but we set up showings for this past Sunday. 30 minutes after the first one we had an offer. Just like that. They accepted our counter-offer and just like that, it's all happening.

God is good! We're still kinda in shock how simple that was. It just...happened. We don't have to go through the list of house-projects we had planned, the process of re-listing, scheduling dozens of showings, none of it. It's done!

Time to plan another house hunting trip to Ormond Beach. :)

## Fun Fact

I can't stop listening to [Vice by Mat Zo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05KYOiSrJI). I often get on these endless-repeat loops with songs. This is my current fixation. I needed _something_ to get [Toss a Coin to Your Witcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS4Q-WWyl3Q) out of my head.

XOXO
