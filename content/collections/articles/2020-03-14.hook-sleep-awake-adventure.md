Watched Hook with the kids tonight. God, I forgot how much I truly loved that movie! I needed that. Watching Robin Williams reclaim his childhood is such a cathartic experience.

We all have something waiting for us in that place between sleep and awake. For me — sometimes — it's the fear of waking up as an old man who missed too much of his life. Othertimes it's moment of clarity — a break from the relentless onslaught of the world. Occassionally it's a moment of brilliance too fleeting to capture with pen or phone.

We're at the beginning of the Coronavirus drama. Sports, events, and travel from Europe are all shut down. Toilet paper is apparently scarce but I'm too proud to go check. The stock market plummeted, sales are way down this month, and in 4 weeks we move out of our home and don't have a new one to move to.

This'll be an adventure to remember!
