I still can't believe we moved. Last night I went over to John's to hang and it only took 3 minutes to get there. My brain couldn't really process it.

Every day has been perfect weather. High 70s, low 80s. The pool is consistently 82ยบ. What more could I ask for?

The one challenge I have though is getting productive with work again. After all the hustle of moving out, visiting folks on the drive down, unloading and setting up, it's hard to stay focused at my computer. I gotta get some momentum going so I can get my groove back.
